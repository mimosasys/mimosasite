        <br><br><br>(Originally posted 19/5/25)
        <h5>1</h5>
        <div name="text">
            <br>My duties as a Goddess are, to most people, surprisingly lax, but humans have never had that good of a grasp on these sorts of things anyway. Actually, it’s hard to even call them ‘duties’ – rather, they are passions of mine that I’m more than happy to take up my time with.
            <br>Sitting pleasantly cross-legged in mid-air, I peer down at the world beneath me. From here, the pedestrians, cars, and buildings are so small that just my hand could cover up a whole city block. It’s a nice way for me to get away from it all – the bustling life of mortals sure is interesting, but not enough for me to spend my whole time amongst them. The time I spend helping them is enough for me.
            <br>I wave my right hand in the air before me, conjuring up a pale blue light at my fingertip that shines and crackles slightly in the late morning sunlight. Flicking my finger downwards, my list of names reveals itself, a list of those who have called for my services. One case catches my eye – three non-humans living together not far from here, and like so many others, yearn for a form that accurately represents how they wish to be seen. It’s a situation I’ve seen and dealt with so many times that I lost count ages ago. It’s nice to see that more people nowadays are becoming more in touch with who they truly are inside. However, for many it is only through my abilities that others may be able to see it too.
            <br>Having picked my destination, I appear on the corner of their street with no effort whatsoever. You might imagine that people would be surprised by someone such as me appearing out of thin air, but most people don’t take enough notice of their surroundings to truly see it.
            <br>Even if one did notice it – <i>there’s no way that could have happened, right? People can’t just vanish and reappear like magic, could they? I must just be imagining things...</i>
            <br>It’s amusing. I get great joy out of making people question reality like this.
            <br>My heels click beautifully as I walk down the paved footpath, shaded by some tall, gnarled trees spaced out just far enough that their shadows barely touch. My long, lilac hair blows gently in the autumn breeze. I wave my hand once again, refreshing myself on the address I’m looking for. One more wave and the glowing light morphs into a small piece of paper that sits neatly in my palm – much less noticeable if anyone were to walk past me. I wouldn’t want to reveal myself that easily, after all.
            <br>Eventually, I arrive at the household. It’s a modest place, but cosy, probably built sometime in the 1970s or 80s, complete with tan brickwork and a large, front-facing window shaded by a perforated metal window shutter. After the driveway is a small pergola, and there’s a small, unobtrusive doorbell beside the white screen door. I push it and take my spot at the steps awaiting recognition from the inhabitants.
            <br>A lady in her mid-to-late 20s opens the door, and looks at me curiously. She’s dressed in what some would probably describe as a very ‘goth’ outfit, complete with a pentagram on a necklace and mesh arm warmers, but I’m not very well versed with human fashion trends. It is a nice outfit, though. Her shoulder-length hair ends with dyed, deep-red tips.
            <br>“Hi, I hope I’m not intruding,” I begin, “is this the residence of Nora Wilson?”
            <br>“That’s me,” she nods and smiles softly.
            <br>“Good, my name’s Rebecca, I’m here about a transformation request you sent on the…” I check the paper quickly. “...15th of last month. Is now a good time?”
            <br>Nora tilts her head, slightly confused.
            <br>“Transformation… request? This is some sort of a joke, right?”
            <br>“Not at all, hun – I pick up on these desires within people whose forms simply do not match their souls.”
            <br>She laughs a little.
            <br>“You’re funny, you know that?”
            <br>“I said I’m not joking. As the Goddess of Entropy, transformation, change, and other such things, it’s all in a day’s work for me. I help non-humans like you all the time.”
            <br>Now she’s looking at me puzzled.
            <br>“Ah, right, nobody usually believes me when I say that. Trust me, hun, I’m not some boring human trying to pass myself off as a deity,” I say, leaning onto my back, kicking my feet off the ground and assuming a floating, cross-legged position again. “I’m as real as they get.”
            <br>Her eyes widen. Seeing that feeling of bewilderment never fails to warm my heart.
            <br>“Y… you’re… how…?” She takes a step out the door to investigate if there’s any sneaky wiring going on, but of course finds none of it. Someone shuffles around inside, but I can’t see them.
            <br>“Yes, yes, I know, you’ll see plenty more unbelievable things than that, don’t you worry. Now, is this a good time? I can come back if you’d rather I do the transformation another day,” I say as I recline further, resting my head on some invisible cushion behind me. Laying in the air like this really is the most comfortable and relaxing thing imaginable.
            <br>“S- sorry, what? The…” she started paying attention again after peering around where I sat.
            <br>“The request you made. You had a deep desire within you to make this…” I gesture to her body. “…external form match with how you feel inside. I’m here to grant that for you and the other two non-humans who live here.”
            <br>“...How do you know about Lacie and Tamsin?”
            <br>“Well, immediately after I picked up on your desire, two more came through from the same place. Figured you must all live together, am I right?”
            <br>“Y- yes, they’re here. Would, uh, would you like to come in?” She questioned, opening the screen door again and gesturing for me to enter with her.
            <br>“That would be lovely,” I smile warmly with a nod. I get back on my feet again, and there’s a slight tap as my shoes touch the ground. Nora shakes her head, once again in disbelief.
            <br>“I… you’re really… a Goddess?”
            <br>“That’s right, though I’ve no ties to any religion or something like that. People have worshipped me in the past, but nowadays it’s different.”
            <br>“Right…” Nora contemplates, shuffling inside and leading me into the kitchen and living area that lies just past the door. One person sits at the kitchen bench, sipping a hot beverage, and another is walking around the cooking area preparing something of their own. A patterned mug sits by itself on the bench corner – that must be Nora’s.
            <br>“Would you like a drink of anything? We were just making one for ourselves.”
            <br>“A nice hot tea would go down fantastically,” I suggest.
            <br>Nora smiles and moves towards the kitchen, gesturing me towards any of the seats.
            <br>“Feel free to sit anywhere,” she smiles, and turns to her housemates. “Uh, so, this is… Rebecca, was it?”
            <br>I nod, and she continues.
            <br>“She’s… somehow heard about… no, she’s a… uh…” Clearly she can’t find a good way to explain it all, it must be all very confusing. “...She’s a Goddess who picked up on that breakdown I had a couple days ago about… you know…” she gestured to her body, “…and she’s… she’s here to help all of us with that…?”
            <br>“That’s right,” I confirm. “It’s a hobby of mine to find people like yourselves and give them a physical form that matches how they see themselves in their head.”
            <br>“...What do you mean she’s a Goddess?” The one sitting down asks.
            <br>I lift my feet into the air again and relax. I feel like it’s getting old at this point, but I guess it never fails to impress. I throw in a hand gesture and the pale blue light appears at my fingertips, dazzling them again.
            <br>“How the hell are you doing that?” They ask.
            <br>“Oh, you know, Goddess things.”
            <br>“N- no, I don’t… I don’t get it… this is…”
            <br>“I know, I’ve heard it all before, trust me. Don’t think about it too much.”
            <br>“This is a dream,” the other one says.
            <br>I put my feet firmly on the ground once again, and Nora walks a cup of tea to me, almost but not quite too hot to hold.
            <br>“Thank you, hun,” I add. “Oh, I call everyone ‘hun’, by the way. It’s one of my many behavioural quirks, I suppose. You don’t have a problem with that, do you? Some people don’t like it.”
            <br>“No, no, it’s fine,” Nora says, and the other two shake and then nod their heads.
            <br>“Good, it’s a hard habit to break,” I jest, pulling one of the bench stools out and taking a seat. I put my cup on the counter top. “Now, before we get into the fun bits, there’s unfortunately some paperwork I’ve got to take care of.”
            <br>I reach into my handbag and pull out three forms, handing one to each of them, along with a ballpoint pen.
            <br>“Don’t worry, you’re not signing over your soul, or something. It’s just so I know exactly what you wish to get out of this experience,” I explain. “Don’t be shy, and don’t hide anything important or you’ll miss out.”
            <br>After a moment of staring at the papers, looking back at me, and staring at the papers again, they each begin to fill in their names and the like.
            <br>“Y… you want to know our species?”
            <br>“Well yes, that’s the entire point. The call for help I got was because you’re not human, yes?”
            <br>“...You can do that?”
            <br>“That’s why I’m here, hun.”
            <br>I peer at their form. Their name is Lacie, which means the one standing next to Nora in the kitchen is Tamsin.
            <br>“I use my status as Goddess of transformation to, well, grant transformations to people just like yourselves. Nice to meet you, Lacie,” I say, smiling at them. They smile back.
            <br>“Transformations?” Tamsin asks.
            <br>“You three are all questions, aren’t you?” I laugh, but understand that this must all seem like some unbelievable scenario unfolding before them. “Right, yes, transformations. That’s the most fun part, you see.”
            <br>I pull out the shimmering blue light again, and trace a loose circle in the air, which soon rights itself and sits neatly just below eye level.
            <br>With one finger I pierce the centre, and there’s a small ripple as I do so. Pointing at Lacie, I feel my finger latch onto their soul, and pull it back through the glowing ring. The outline of a body reveals itself, and I can already see many inconsistencies between their external form and internal one. I’ll work my way up to those, and for now just do my usual transformation example. I gently touch the outline of their wrists, then their ankles, and move one to the other.
            <br>“Don’t try stand up,” I say, briefly. “It’s about to get a lot harder.”
            <br>I outline the circle once again, and the transformation realises itself. It takes a moment for Lacie to notice exactly what just happened, but then immediately disregards my warning to not stand and trips backwards on her shoes that now don’t fit the hands at the end of their legs, and fails to grip the bench top with the feet at the end of their arms.
            <br>I catch them, standing from my seat and reaching over with one hand, before helping them sit once again.
            <br>“That’s… how the fuck… I don’t… I don’t understand…” There’s some wonder in their voice, but it is mostly confusion.
            <br>“There you have it – a transformation. This is just an introductory one. Don’t worry, I’ll turn it off in a moment,” I say slowly, letting them really soak in what just happened.
            <br>By now, Nora and Tamsin have come around this side of the bench and are also staring in bewilderment at their partner’s switched extremities.
            <br>“Can you like, move them?” Nora asks, curiously.
            <br>In response, Lacie wiggles her toes, and Nora feigns a vomiting sound.
            <br>“Ew, ew, ew, ew,” she exclaims, laughing.
            <br>“I can change it back if you want,” I add, just enjoying the spectacle, relaxing in the air again.
            <br>“No, I’ll keep it for a bit, this is kinda funny,” Lacie smiles, looking at the things at the ends of her wrists curiously. “This is so fucking weird,” they say.
            <br>“You should try grabbing onto something with your hands,” I suggest. “That’s usually the weirdest part.”
            <br>I can’t see it, but I can tell they’ve tried to and successfully grabbed the legs of the stool, and a wild grin emerges on their face.
            <br>“I… I can’t… describe this… You two have to experience this,” they beam to the two onlookers.
            <br>“I’d rather not,” Nora chuckles, “feet things weird me out.”
            <br>“Same,” Tamsin agrees.
            <br>“I know, me too, but… it’s nothing weird, it’s just… it’s new, right? I can’t grip anything up here, but the feeling of being able to actually hold onto something with my… hands? Feet? It’s just insane.”
            <br>“That’s exactly the sort of thing I’m here to share,” I add. “Well, maybe not exactly this, but transformations in general.”
            <br>I grab an invisible something in the air above me, and gently wipe away the transformation sigil like an eraser on a blackboard. Lacie’s hands and feet return to normal, and they stretch their fingers, then crack their knuckles.
            <br>“Aw, I was looking forward to messing with those,” they laugh, tapping their hands together, back where they’re supposed to be.
            <br>“I know, that can come later. But there’s those forms to fill out, and I don’t think you’d have enough dexterity to be able to write like that.”
            <br>Nora and Tamsin pull their forms over to this side, sitting down on the other two benches, and now concentrate on writing.
            <br>After several questions about how much detail they should go into on their ideal forms, they each hand their self-descriptions back to me, and I take a quick read of each.
            <br>“So you three are these sort-of stereotypical feminine demon-looking creatures, am I getting that right?”
            <br>The three of them nod enthusiastically.
            <br>“You can really make this happen? Like, you can make me look… like that?” Nora questions, her eyes beaming with hope.
            <br>“I guarantee it. I might not get all the details the first time but we’ll figure it all out soon enough,” I reassure them. “Shall we get started? Where would be the best place for this? I usually suggest a bedroom. It’s the most comfortable room, usually.”
            <br>“The bedroom’s just down the corridor,” Nora says.
            <br>“Lead the way,” I say, taking a step back.
            <br>Two of them get up straight away, but Lacie finishes her coffee before joining them. I follow them down the corridor, before we arrive at what must be the bedroom door.
            <br>“Oh, one last thing I should explain,” I add. “Doing full-body transformations like this tends to make people rather… excited, so to speak. I’m not one to get involved with that sort of thing, but feel free to do whatever comes to mind.”
            <br>The three of them blush slightly, looking at each other, smiling.
            <br>“That won’t be a problem,” Tamsin says, perhaps a little shyly. “It happens sometimes with us,” they explain.
            <br>“Wonderful,” I smile back, “it’s all about enjoying oneself. Your true self. It’s usually a very overwhelming sensory experience for everyone involved.”
            <br>Nora smiles gently again, somewhat nervous but very emotional.
            <br>“Shall we begin?” I ask.
        </div>

        <h5 id="tearsofademon2">2</h5>
        <div name="text">
            <br>Their bedroom seems a very comfortable place.
            <br>“Uh, sorry about the mess,” Nora says, motioning to a pile of clothes in the corner. Dirty laundry, I assume. It doesn’t bother me.
            <br>“Don’t worry about it,” I reassure her, “my partner’s room is just as bad. I’ve seen it all before.”
            <br>Now that we’re here, the three of them just sort of stand there awkwardly.
            <br>“So, uh, now what?” asks Lacie.
            <br>“Get yourselves comfortable, whatever that looks like. I do suggest for permanent and full-body transformations like this to undress, but that’s up to you. Honestly, I’m no voyeur – its purely an aesthetic beauty for me. I understand it’s embarrassing to undress around a complete stranger, though, so no pressure.”
            <br>“I’ll, uh, stick to having clothes on, thanks,” Nora said shakily. The other two seemed to agree.
            <br>“Alright, just do what’s most comfortable for you all. I would suggest at least just sitting down, though.”
            <br>In response, the three lovers chose a spot on the bedside, looking apprehensively at each other.
            <br>“Right, any volunteers to go first? How about you, Nora? You’re the one who called me out here, after all.”
            <br>Nora blushed, embarrassed.
            <br>“I don’t… uh…”
            <br>“It’s alright, I can start with one of the others if you’re not ready yet. It’s a big thing, I get it.”
            <br>Nora nods silently, so I turn my attention to Lacie instead.
            <br>“Well, you’ve already felt a transformation, so perhaps I’ll start with you, Lacie?”
            <br>They smile, looking quickly at Nora, placing their hand on her back gently.
            <br>“Yeah, alright, I’ll go first,” they smirk cheekily.
            <br>I draw that brilliant circle in the air once again, and grasp at their soul, dragging it into the ring.
            <br>“Wonderful,” I smile. “Let’s take a look, shall we?”
            <br>I pull Lacie’s completed form out of my bag. They’ve written in a lot of detail exactly how they’d imagine something like this going. Clearly, they’ve thought about this before.
            <br>Of note – they wish for the transformation to be slow, able to feel every single change as I work my magic, exactly how I like it.
            <br>“Would you like the most vivid changes first? Or should I save them for last?”
            <br>“Vivid…?”
            <br>“Your tail, hun. Would you like that now, or should I save the best for last?”
            <br>“My tail…” they murmured, looking behind them at an empty space on the bed, yearning. “Now, please,” they said, shakily.
            <br>Touching gently on the outline of their abdomen, I drag out the base of their spine into a thin, bony structure, then wave my hand over the base, filling in the muscle, tendons, fat, and skin. And for a finishing touch, the stereotypical triangular point at the end, just as Lacie requested.
            <br>“Alright. You ready? This is going to feel very strange,” I caution, knowing the answer already.
            <br>Lacie nods delightedly. Nora and Tamsin hold Lacie’s hands gently, excited to see what exactly is about to happen.
            <br>“Well, here we go. Say goodbye to the last of your humanity.”
            <br>One last wave of my hand and the sigil vanishes, and immediately Lacie reacts, standing suddenly yet hesitantly.
            <br>“Oh, fuck,” they murmur, “I can feel it.”
            <br>Something shifts under her clothing, now growing slowly and sensitively just as they wished. A curve begins pushing itself against their skirt, searching its way down and out.
            <br>“I- it’s so…”
            <br>Lacie tries to grasp at it, and it twitches in response. They nearly collapse to their knees from the sensitivity of it all. After all, they’re feeling new nerves, skin, flesh and bone all for the first time.
            <br>Nora and Tamsin watch unblinking as a deep red triangle pokes out the skirt bottom, before beginning to lift itself up and into the air. Almost at its full length, it sits up proudly before the top finally relaxes just below head height.
            <br>A tail finally protrudes from their abdomen, and Lacie is ecstatic.
            <br>“I… I can’t believe it…” they whisper. “I can… I can feel all of it…”
            <br>They flex their new muscles, and the tail stiffens itself out, causing the fresh scaly skin to glimmer in the artificial light. Tamsin gasps. Nora begins to cry.
            <br>“It’s your tail…” she whimpers, overcome with emotion. “You’re so beautiful…”
            <br>Lacie gestures to a mirror behind me, and I move out of the way so they can finally observe just what’s happened. Now they begin to cry, too, seeing their own tail fully for the first time, testing out the new muscles and seeing how it reacts.
            <br>I find myself getting emotional too. It truly is a magical experience watching someone become so euphoric upon seeing their true self as they were meant to be. I wipe a single tear from my eye, and smile at Lacie warmly.
            <br>“Shall I continue? It’s only going to get better from here.”
            <br>“Oh god, please,” they almost moan. “I mean – g… gosh? Goddess? Am I allowed to say that?”
            <br>“Use my name in vain, I don’t care. It’s not like it hurts me or anything,” I shrug.
            <br>I summon the same sigil again, tracing around their body, touching gently their chest, their hips, their fingertips and toes, before drawing in two magnificent horns at the top of their head. I throw in some sharp biting teeth and a forked tongue for good measure, too.
            <br>“Right, everything else is set. May I?”
            <br>Clutching their new tail, they nod. Their tail wags in unison. Again their knees become weak, and I haven’t even started the new transformation yet.
            <br>I complete the circle. So much is starting to happen at once, Lacie doesn’t know what to focus their attention on.
            <br>The scales erupting from underneath the last of their human skin as if turning itself inside out.
            <br>The sharp, thick black talons replacing their fingernails and toenails.
            <br>The two brilliant horns, almost curling in on themselves completely, now protruding out of their skull, bursting through their newly, nearly impossibly black hair at a remarkable rate.
            <br>Their chest blooming and blossoming, becoming more sensitive than they could ever imagine.
            <br>Lacie lays face-up on the carpet, arms and legs extended, slowly blinking and breathing deeply. Tears run down their cheeks.
            <br>“L… Lacie?” Nora asks, of course having witnessed the whole thing, surely wondering what’s in store for her soon.
            <br>“I’m alright, Nora,” they try to say, but find themselves fumbling a little with their newly forked tongue. It makes them hold a crimson and clawed hand to their mouth.
            <br>They sit up, shifting their tail beneath them, taking another look at themselves in the mirror next to me.
            <br>It doesn’t take long for them to almost tear their shirt and undergarments off, staring at their smooth and glimmering red body. They put their hands to their now enlarged breasts, and gasp.
            <br>Leaning in closer, they open their mouth and stick their tongue out. It’s a much brighter red than the rest of their body. They find they can easily move the two forked ends separately, and flicks it with one of their talons.
            <br>They turn to face Nora and Tamsin, who both cannot believe what they’re seeing. They both stand and embrace their lover, who gasps yet again, perhaps from the sensitivity, or perhaps from the sheer strength of the grasp. It’s now that they all notice that Lacie has also grown at least 30 centimetres taller, due to standing on the tips of their new talons.
            <br>“It’s… it’s really you… It’s how I’ve seen you this whole time, Lacie…” Nora whimpers through tears.
            <br>“I… I know, Nora… It’s…” Lacie can’t finish their sentence. It’s all too much for them. Instead, they lean over with their newfound height and whisper into Nora’s ear, flicking their snake-like tongue as they do so. “You’re going to be so beautiful, too.”
            <br>Nora melts.
            <br>“Want to go next?” I ask her.
            <br>Nora nods so fast that her head is a blur.
            <br>“Good, seems you’ve come to your senses. As for your partner however…” I glance over at Lacie. “You’ve done an incredible job, Lacie. Lose yourself in this. Find all the little details.”
            <br>“Fuck, yes I will,” they exclaim, bounding over to the bed, ready to watch their lovers achieve a beautiful form just like them.
            <br>“Alright, Nora, sit down. Get comfortable,” I instruct her, folding up Lacie’s form and grabbing hers instead.
            <br>Nora wants things a little differently. A lighter shade of red, veering almost into pink, but not quite. More of a luster to her scales. Not particularly interested in being any taller. Straighter horns. Some curious markings over her skin, like tattoos. She’s even drawn an example. And, importantly, all at once with no growth time like with Lacie. To each their own, I suppose.
            <br>Nora’s crying still, though it’s noticeably different now. I don’t think it’s solely out of happiness anymore. Tamsin’s also clearly noticed.
            <br>“Are you alright, Nora?” She says, running a hand down her arm.
            <br>“I just… d- do I deserve this? I haven’t worked for this, I haven’t had to prove myself or anything… it’s just being handed to me…” she admits.
            <br>“Hun,” I reply, “nobody should have to work to simply see themselves in the mirror. To see the right face staring back at them. What you don’t deserve is to see this anymore.”
            <br>“That’s right,” Tamsin reassures her, placing a hand on her knee, “you wouldn’t say that Lacie or I don’t deserve it, right? It’s who we are, and we can finally express that as it should have been all this time. Right, Lacie…?”
            <br>Lacie’s too busy breathing heavily and exploring their body to respond.
            <br>“Oh, don’t worry about them, I told you it’s a perfectly normal reaction to all of this.”
            <br>“They’ve got… that’s a… a vagina…”
            <br>“Of course it is. That’s what’s meant to be there, after all,” I add. “Clearly they’re enjoying it.”
            <br>“Fuck,” Lacie moans, forked tongue flicking in and out of their mouth as they speak, tracing their lips gently. “It’s so much better than I imagined…”
            <br>“Another happy customer,” I say lightly. “Want to join them, Nora?”
            <br>“Y- yeah…” she sobbed, wiping away tears. “Please… I… I need that.”
            <br>“Damn right you do,” I say, finding myself getting excited too.
            <br>After the correct hand gestures for Nora, I nod at her, and she nods back readily.
            <br>“No teasing or anything, right?” I ask. “Just straight to the point?”
            <br>“That’s right,” she says, having made it through this bout of tears. I’m sure there will be more to come in a few moments, though.
            <br>“Ok, here we go. Doing it all at once is a sudden shift, so take some deep breaths, alright?”
            <br>Nora nods, and begins breathing deeply. I join her.
            <br>“On three, alright? One… two…”
            <br>The sigil completes once again, and Nora exhales sharply. Just as she requested, there’s no warning, no fanfare, not so much as a puff of smoke – just a wave of my hand and now a glistening red demon sits in front of me.
            <br>The first thing she does is grab her horns with her newly scaled fingers. Even the sight of her reddened arms makes her fall back, which presses her tail into the mattress, and she nearly screams, overcome with emotion and sensation. Sure enough, tears begin streaming down her face, and she briefly looks at me.
            <br>The new Nora turns over onto her front, and on all fours directs her attention to Lacie. They lock eyes, and Nora crawls over at astonishing speed, her tail high in the air, before collapsing onto her partner. Lacia begins tracing over Nora’s markings, before leaning in closer, and the moaning becomes louder.
            <br>“One left,” I say, turning to Tamsin, who at this point could just jump right in with them, even without a transformation. But, just to be sure…
            <br>Tamsin wants an experience more like Lacia, but her form is slightly different, and is covered in tattoos similar to Nora.
            <br>“I won’t keep you waiting, Tamsin,” I whisper to her, careful to not disturb the other two. She grins back at me with excitement. Like Lacia before her, she wants the process to be intense and wildly sensitive. Unlike them, though, she wants it all at once.
            <br>It isn’t long before her very own tail bursts out from her abdomen, this time covered in a dark brown fur that culminates in a fuzzball at the end. Some fur pushes itself out of her back, too, and she can’t quite resist the urge to itch it with her freshly sharp talons. It’s fortunate then, that her demonic, scaly skin is much more durable than human flesh.
            <br>She too, grows vertically – her whole form enlarges and stretches, leaving her even taller than before, easily seven feet in height. Her horns grant her even more height, curving back and along her head, before ending in a sharp point straight upwards. The final touch is those glowing, golden irises she requested, surrounded by pitch-black scleras.
            <br>She checks her new, fresh body out in the mirror, before hugging me – towering over me – thanking me greatly, and diving into the mess being made on the bed. With claws and teeth like those, no human would survive, but alas, these are no humans.
            <br>I didn’t come here for the ‘personal’ fun they’re having, though. Not this time, at least. I figure it’s best to give them some privacy, and I leave a card of mine floating just in front of the bedroom door. I’m sure they’ll get to it in a few hours or so.

        <br><br><br>(Originally posted 12/6/25)
        <h5></h5>
        <div name="text">
            <br>I have some distant memories of long before my most recent awakening. As far as I know, I’ve been asleep for eight-or-nine-hundred years until I woke roughly a decade ago now. Memories of my past are few and far between, but it’s always comforting to look back on what I do recall.
            <br>I can’t remember exactly where it was in the world, or even how long ago it was, but I was living in a well-built, round house made out of large bricks of sandstone. A very colourful hand-woven carpet sat on the floor in the centre, and some wooden furniture dotted the walls and windowsills. It was enough for me, and it wasn’t like I needed it anyway.
            <br>But, those whose village I inhabited treated me well enough, despite my requests not to be constantly showered with gifts and niceties. That’s where the carpet came from.
            <br>The memory continues, and I remember a young girl, maybe 12 or 13 years of age, being directed to speak with me by her parents, who knocked on my door and politely requested to talk. Of course, I welcomed them inside. They remarked something about how my place seemed more humble than they expected.
            <br>After a moment, they stepped back and their child approached me, holding something in her hands.
            <br>“Miss Goddess,” I think she spoke, “I um, made this for you.”
            <br>She presented me with a wooden carving, perhaps for stamping, that depicted me in a very dramatic pose. At the top there was a small hole all the way through, I suppose so it could be hung on display. She was clearly very talented to be able to depict a humanoid form at such a young age.
            <br>“Oh, this is… this is wonderful,” I said, amazed. “You really carved this yourself? It’s beautiful.”
            <br>The girl blushed, smiling sweetly and looking back to her parents briefly.
            <br>“She’s been working on it for months,” her mother said. “It’s been difficult for us to get her to stop, really,” she laughed.
            <br>I remember we chatted for a little bit, and I did find out the girl’s name, but I seem to have forgotten it.
            <br>A few days after this, though, the girl came back to me, alone. It was in the evening, and the sun had begun to set, tinting the sky a beautiful, striking orange.
            <br>The girl knocked quietly – I almost didn’t hear it, but it was lucky I went to check the door anyway.
            <br>“Oh, it’s you. Is everything alright?” I asked, a little concerned. “Where are your parents?”
            <br>“At home,” she mumbled.
            <br>“You haven’t snuck out, have you?”
            <br>Her face flushed red, and she looked at the ground, evidently.
            <br>“You naughty little thing,” I chuckled lightly. “It’s alright, if you want to stay with me for a little while, that’s fine. You’re safe here.”
            <br>She grinned widely, grabbing my hand I was using to hold the door open.
            <br>“T-thanks, Miss Goddess…”
            <br>I led her inside, giving her a cushion, and we both sat on the carpet in the middle of the room.
            <br>“I really do appreciate your carving from the other day. I’m keeping it very safe, don’t worry,” I said, showing her how I’d been using it as a necklace with a piece of twine I’d found laying around the place. She was clearly thrilled about this, but her expression changed after a while to something much more concerning for me.\
            <br>“Now, is something bothering you? You seem upset. People don’t normally come see me for no reason,” I questioned.
            <br>The girl nodded, not really wanting to make eye contact with me.
            <br>“You can tell me, it’s alright. Is it to do with your parents? Is that why you’ve come alone?”
            <br>The girl shrugged, but clearly I was on the right track since she looked around nervously.
            <br>“It’s, um…” she began, “they don’t really get it…”
            <br>“Get what, child?”
            <br>“I don’t um, I don’t get that much time alone, and um…” she mumbled, “I’m thinking about a lot of things.”
            <br>“They don’t? That’s a shame. I mean, I understand they want to take care of you and keep you safe, but everyone needs time for themselves. Privacy is so important.”
            <br>She nodded silently.
            <br>“But, why have you come to me?”
            <br>“It just… seems safe with you…” she said, quietly, as if admitting a long-hidden secret. This touched my very soul.
            <br>“I see… Is there anything I can help with? Or would you just like some time here?”
            <br>“...I think I just want to s-stay here for a while…”
            <br>“That’s perfectly fine with me, child. Make yourself at home,” I smiled.
            <br>“T-thank you…” she smiled back, tears in her eyes.
            <br>I had a feeling there was more to her home situation than she wanted to let on, but that’s alright. As long as she could stay here, I would keep her safe.
            <br>It was maybe an hour until her parents came knocking at the door, panicked and pale-faced. I debated not telling them she was here, but it was getting late and I didn’t quite have the facilities to take care of a child. She was sad to go, but I said she was allowed to come back anytime she pleased.
            <br>Her parents were somewhat confused, but were glad she hadn’t gotten into any danger, and thanked me for taking care of her. As they were leaving, I asked one of them aside to explain the situation. I think it was her father I talked to, but it was that long ago that I forget those details.\
            <br>I told him what she’d told me, about how she’d run away to just have some time for herself. He was surprised, but at the same time, understanding. I said that, while I don’t have any experience with kids, privacy is something that is surely important to everyone. He agreed, and explained that he and his partner just didn’t want her to get in any danger, understandably.
            <br>“While that may be true,” I told him, “it’s important that she has places to be herself, and feel safe.”
            <br>“…Is she not safe with me?”
            <br>“She may have alluded to that, yes. I suggest sitting her down and having a friendly conversation about it all. Really try to listen to her. She’s a smart kid, don’t think she doesn’t know what’s good for her.”
            <br>“…I understand,” he admitted eventually. “If you don’t mind, I’ll head back home.”
            <br>“Of course,” I said. “Take care of her, OK? And if she ever runs off again, I think you’ll know where to find her. Perhaps ask her to tell you before she comes over here next time, alright? She’s welcome here anytime,” I smiled.
            <br>“Absolutely,” he said sternly, but not with any malice. He nodded his head, went for a bow, but I signalled for him not to bother with that sort of thing.

        <hr>
        <h5 id="ashorttangent"></h5>
        <div name="text">
            <br>At some point I would have had to leave that village permanently, though of course I don’t remember why. I do recall that I would move around from time to time, visiting a few different places as the seasons changed. I can’t even remember where any of those places were, unfortunately, and I doubt there’s be any surviving record of my existence at all. At least, I haven’t found any so far.
            <br>I’m not sure what exactly came of that girl, or the etching she made. I really wish I could find it again, but I suppose it’s just been lost to time, like so much else of the past. It certainly wasn’t English she spoke, that’s for sure. I’m not even sure what my name was at the time.
            <br>As for my influence on humanity, who knows. I suppose I should know more than anyone that it’s in the nature of the universe for things to decay and disintegrate – why would my presence be any different? I may be the avatar of entropy, but that doesn’t mean I’m immune to it all.
            <br>It’s a shame, really, having grown attached to being around humans and mortals really shows how different my sense of time is to theirs. I mean, even my last period of dormancy lasted for generations upon generations, and the world has changed so much from what I remember.
            <br>I think that’s partially why I’m trying to take a lot more in this time around, and to make a lot more memorable experiences. It’s why I’ve got a romantic partner – two, in fact – for the first time in my life. It’s why I’m spending so much more time to just observe people, listen to their experiences, and help out where I can. It’s at least fascinating to be surrounded by mortals so much. They’re so funny.
            <br>If I may “break the fourth wall” for a moment, dear reader, I should say that I am not some “character” being written for the sake of a story, nor a persona or something dreamt up by an author to live through vicariously. I am as real as you are. A real Goddess. I live, eat, and sleep on the exact same Earth as you, in this very moment. Nothing written in this work is fiction.
            <br>You are probably still doubting this, and all things considered, I don’t blame you at all. How could it be possible, after all, for a being like me to exist unnoticed? I ask myself this all the time, in fact. I’d love for my handiwork to be noticed.
            <br>The answer – for better or for worse – is that my current existence is shared with many others, all of us going about our lives at the same time, sharing a body. It’s what many people today refer to as plurality, or multiplicity, or something along those lines.
            <br>As such, I currently am not in possession of all of my divine abilities due to being stuck in this limited human body. That doesn’t mean I don’t still make the most of things, though, and it absolutely doesn’t mean that any of the “stories” written in this work aren’t real. I have my ways, trust me.
            <br>I’m looking into all sorts of things. The human body and mind are more plastic than people would have you believe. And, as it turns out, I might not need to be able to physically alter one’s body in order to give them a transformational experience after all – I’ll explain later, I promise.
            <br>Physical transformation does help, though. I do miss being able to wave my hands around like that and just cause chaos if I wished. Gosh, what fun. Nothing compares.
            <br>If I might circle back briefly to the topic of romance for a moment, it’s not something I’d ever seriously considered until recently, which some may find curious since many of the transformations I help others out with are explicitly, well, <i>explicit</i> in nature. I’m of course well aware that there’s a world of difference between a sexual relationship and a romantic one, but I’ve never really been in either.
            <br>Sex isn’t really interesting to me as something to be a part of. I like that I can help others get to a point where they feel comfortable partaking in it, or at least appreciating their own body in that sort of way, but I’ve never felt a need to actually partake in it myself. It feels almost wrong, somehow. It just isn’t for me.
            <br>Amelia says this means I can label myself as asexual in a sense, but I don’t feel like I should concern myself with human-made descriptors. It’s not a bad thought, though. For now I just put it up to my divinity making me indescribable to mortals. I like the sound of that. There’s probably a lot about me that doesn’t make sense to mortals, and that’s the way I like it.
            <br>I hope you don’t mind me going on a bit of a tangent about my own personal experiences. You probably expected a story, and I assure you there are absolutely more on the way. I just thought it might be nice to share some context about my life at the moment. I guess, in a way, all the stories I’ll tell are memories of my own, after all.
            <br>Sorry to disappoint you with memories if you were just after visceral transformation. I will do it again.
            <br>Don’t fret, though, there’s plenty more transformation on the way – some for validation, some for experimentation, some for pleasure – there’s something for everyone, I’m sure. I hope you stick around to read it.
