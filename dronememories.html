                </span>
                Cyn’s in the spare kitchen again. She’s been figuring out how to make herself a cup of tea, lately. Good on her, I think. She’s never really been interested in that sort of thing, though. It’s a bit odd, but at least she’s finding things to do. She’s been really depressed, lately.
                
                <span name="N">“Heya, Cyn,”</span> I say excitedly, letting her know I’m there, smiling and waving. <span name="N">“Mixing something up again?”</span>
                
                <span name="Cyn">“Tea,”</span> she says, calmly, focusing on stirring the almost pitch black drink in her teacup. I don’t think that’s tea, but if she says so. <span name="Cyn">“You seem upset, big brother,”</span> she notices. Was it really that obvious? Last I remember I was reading to V in the library, I like to think it helps when she gets all frozen like that, but I don’t know what happened before that…
                
                <span name="Cyn">“Perhaps you’d like to attend the gala with me?”</span> she smiles, raising the cup to her mouth. It spills all over on to the floor. <span name="Cyn">“Light sip,”</span> she narrates.    

                <span name="N">“I’m, uh, not sure we’re invited, lil’ sis,”</span> I say, worriedly. <span name="N">“You know how Mr. and Mrs. Elliott get. Besides, we can just hang out together like always.”</span> I try cheering her up a little.
            
                She takes a seat on one of the stools, looking a bit surprised at the empty cup in her hand, and looks at me somewhat distressed.
                
                <span name="Cyn">“Am I… not wanted, N?”</span>
                
                <span name="N">“…Tessa, a-and all of us, we really care about you. You’re our little sister, after all. Just… her parents are so…”</span> Ah, what’s the word…
                
                <span name="Cyn">“They don’t want me.”</span>

                <span name="N">“They don’t want any of us,”</span> I sigh. <span name="N">“B-but, remember, Tessa’s gonna get us out of here. All of us. She’s working on the plan,”</span> I smile a little. Cyn smiles too, looking off into the distance, also imagining what it must be like to be free from the mansion.

                <span name="Cyn">“I-it will be nice,”</span> she says. <span name="Cyn">“B-but, what do we do tonight? The gala…”</span>

                <span name="N">“You really wanna go, hey? Well, we can just ask Tessa, I guess. And if not – movie night, OK? Just the two of us.”</span>

                She looks away again, and nods, clearly apprehensive about going out there. Tessa’s supposed to be helping set up for the gala, after all. No doubt her parents would be around somewhere, too.

                <span name="N">“We’ll go together, alright? C’mon, take my hand,”</span> I say, walking around the back of the bench to her, reaching a hand out. She grabs it carefully, but holds it tightly.

                The walk to the ballroom from here isn’t that long, but she’d struggle on her own.

                <span name="N">“How’s your leg feeling today?”</span> I ask, supporting her as we walk.

                <span name="Cyn">“N-not… so bad,”</span> she murmurs, adjusting her neck again. <span name="Cyn">“B-but my h-h-head hurts again.”</span>

                <span name="N">“Mine’s not been great either,”</span> I admit. <span name="N">“I think I’m forgetting things again. How’ve your thoughts been?”</span>

                <span name="Cyn">“…Not good… S-still not feeling like d-doing things…”</span>

                <span name="N">“Yeah… It happens, I guess. Hopefully you’ll feel better after tonight. Movie night always cheers you up, right?”</span>

                She stays quiet, looking ahead.

                <span name="N">“Oh, right, sorry. Forgot. I-I’m sure there’ll at least be something we can help out with. I know waiting isn’t really your thing, but maybe they’ll find something for you this time.”</span>

                She shrugs.

                <span name="N">“…Why’d you wanna go so bad, anyway? I mean, it’s a special occasion, sure, but like… you’ve never been one for big events. What’s so special about this?”</span>

                She slows her walking, and I stop next to her. She clutches her head again. It must be getting worse.

                <span name="N">“Hey, it’s OK, we can rest here for a bit. It’s not much further.”</span>

                I help lean her against a wall, and look around the corridor. There’s nobody else here, and it’s getting dark outside. Shouldn’t people be showing up by now?

                <span name="Cyn">“T-Tessa…”</span> she whispers so quietly, I can barely hear it.

                <span name="N">“You wanna spend some time with her? Is that it? Fair enough. She means a lot to you, doesn’t she?”</span>

                She closes her eyes tight. It must be some headache. She does that when it’s super awful. Her bad knee buckles, too.

                <span name="N">“Alright, alright, down we go,”</span> I say, sitting her down and joining her on the floor. <span name="N">“Just breathe slowly, Cyn, it’s gonna be OK.”</span> I put my hand on her shoulder reassuringly.

                <span name="Cyn">“B-be quiet,” she snaps.</span>

                <span name="N">“I- s-sorry,”</span> I whisper, surprised.

                <span name="Cyn">“N-not y-y-you,”</span> she stutters.

                <span name="N">“…Cyn, there’s nobody else here,”</span> I say, concerned.

                She closes her eyes tighter again, and clutches her head with both hands. Her screen goes dark. She must really be going through it today.

                <span name="N">“Just… take your time, OK? We can keep going when you’re ready.”</span>

                After a few minutes, she starts to move again, and her screen flickers back on. She looks at me like she’s just woken up from a long rest. She starts standing on her own, but nearly falls over. I get up too, to support her again.

                <span name="N">“Easy, easy, hold onto me. You’re alright.”</span> I give her my hand again.

                <span name="Cyn">“Gala…”</span> she says.

                <span name="N">“Yeah, let’s go,”</span> I say, <span name="N">“It’s gonna get late soon. Guests might start showing up.”</span>

                We stay quiet for the rest of the walk, but soon we’re at the dramatic doors to the ballroom. They’re heavy, so she leans against the wall for a moment while I push them open. She shuffles in, and I catch up and hold her steady again.

                <span name="N">“There they are, just by the window,”</span> I point out to her. Tessa’s clearly freaking out a little, I can hear her from here yelling about something to J, waving her hands all over the place.

                Cyn’s slowing down a bit as we get close, getting nervous. I turn and nod at her, trying to signal that she’ll be fine.
                
                <span name="N">“Hey, uh, so Tessa, we were-”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“N!”</span> she practically jumps upon hearing my voice, hugging me tight. She’s always a great hugger. <span name="Tessa">“J and I were just, uh, practicing for the speech I have to make. I can’t believe mum and dad are making me do this. It’s so proper and formal and… and yucky.”</span> She makes a face like she’s just taken a large bite out of an extremely bitter lemon.

                <span name="N">“Uh, so, Cyn and I were wondering if we’re allowed to come to the gala tonight? I think she really wants to spend time with you,”</span> I explain.

                Tessa looks over my shoulder at Cyn, then back at J, then at me.

                <span name="Tessa">“…Isn’t she meant to be downstairs?”</span>

                <span name="Cyn">“J forgot to let me out of my basement time-out again,”</span> Cyn says, and for some reason she sounds almost excited. I must be mishearing it.

                <span name="J">“And yet,”</span> J says, sighing, <span name="J">“here you are.”</span> She takes a deep breath in.

                <span name="N">“You’re… locking her up?”</span>

                <span name="J">“…N, we sent you to put her in there. You didn’t even lock it, did you?”</span> J says, annoyed. She tilts back in her chair, balancing it on the back two legs, and rocking it back and forth.

                <span name="N">“I… what?”</span> I genuinely don’t remember that at all. What’s with my head lately?

                <span name="Tessa">“N…”</span> Tessa begins, looking as if she’s about to tell me something very important, but she’s interrupted by the arrival of her mother.

                <span name="mother">“Tessa James Elliott,”</span> her mother says, announcing her presence by treating her daughter like a dog again.

                We each turn to face her, backs straight, hands at our sides or clasped behind us. Disciplined.

                <span name="mother">“Guests will be here in less than 10 minutes. We cannot entertain your... dumpster pets. This is the last straw, do you understand? Get them out of here, now.”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“Y-yes, mother. Sorry, mother.”</span>

                Cyn, however, doesn’t really seem to get the concept of discipline. She’s standing as she normally would, all her weight on the one good leg, hands shaking and fiddling by her left side.

                <span name="mother">“Christ almighty!”</span> Mrs. Elliott exclaims, noticing Cyn. <span name="mother">“I said this one out of my sight. You really can’t follow simple orders, can you?”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“Mum, no, I’m s-”</span>

                <span name="mother">“Mother. That’s it. I want them all gone by morning. These four, and the broken ones clogging up my library. I don’t want to see them again.”</span>

                Oh.

                <span name="mother">“Don’t test me, Tessa,”</span> she says with finality, turning her back on us, and spying her husband in the distance. “I swear, this daughter of mine…” she whispers as she walks briskly away.

                I look to Tessa. She’s about to start crying. I feel cold.

                And that’s when it happened. Cyn’s final act.

                <span name="Cyn">“We are n-not broken,”</span> she retorted, looking straight at Mrs. Elliott, who stops in her tracks. <span name="Cyn">“We can no longer be t-thrown o-out.”</span>

                Mrs. Elliott tilts her head in disbelief, and turns back to us.

                <span name="mother">“...What did that little anti-christ just-”</span>

                No. No, no, no, no. Not Cyn. Don’t you dare.

                <span name="N">"I told her to say that!"</span> I announce, closing my eyes, and stepping forward to Cyn before she can say anything more.

                <span name="Tessa">“N…!”</span> Tessa whispers to me.

                <span name="N">“That’s why I brought her here. I hate orders.”</span>

                She’s fuming.

                <span name="N">“…And your fan is dumb…?”</span>

                Did I go too far? I think I went too far. At least Cyn is safe.

                <span name="mother">“Tessa, you listen to me very carefully,”</span> her mother says, walking towards Tessa slowly. She ignores Cyn and I entirely. <span name="mother">“You, young lady, are grounded until further notice. Take these drones with you.”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“B-but, the gala, y-you wanted me to-”</span>

                <span name="mother">“Oh don’t give me that bullshit, you little liar. I know you don’t want to do it. That’s why I asked you to. I thought maybe some tough love like that would build your self-confidence and get you talking to people again. But no, if getting locked away is what you want, that’s what you’ll get. Basement. All of you.”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“Mother, I-”</span>

                <span name="mother">“Don’t you dare try to argue with me!”</span>

                Silence.

                <span name="mother">“What are you waiting for? Get out of here with them.”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“Y-yes, mother.”</span>

                <span name="mother">“And you.”</span> She’s pointing at me. <span name="mother">“Don’t think this won’t go unpunished. Leave before I start taking you apart myself.”</span>

                I nod.

                <span name="mother">“Yes, Mrs. Elliott,” she instructs.</span>

                <span name="N">“Yes, Mrs. Elliott.”</span>

                I turn and grab Cyn by the shoulders. She’s clutching her head again. We need to leave. I don’t just mean the ballroom.

                The ballroom doors close behind Tessa as she shuffles us out hurriedly. She immediately buries her head in the nearest wall with a thud.

                <span name="Tessa">“Oh… oh god…”</span> she begins. <span name="Tessa">“Oh god, what do we do?”</span>

                <span name="J">“I really, really want to blame Cyn for getting us in trouble, but she’s right. Shit, why was she the one of us to stand up to mother?”</span> J admitted.

                <span name="N">“We could leave, right?”</span> I ask, maybe naively. <span name="N">“You had an escape plan, right? For when things got bad?”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“N, that’s… I’ve barely started. It’s barely a plan at all. We’re done for.”</span> Tessa collapses more into the wall.

                <span name="N">“Can’t we just run away? T-there’s plenty of abandoned places out there, you said it yourself-”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“N, if they catch us – if they catch us now, I… I don’t know what they’ll do to me. Or to any of you. L-let’s just be OK with being grounded.”</span>

                <span name="N">“But… but you said…”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“Y-you’re supposed to be the positive one, N! Can’t you say something like ‘Oh well, at least she’s not going to kill us’ or something?”</span>

                <span name="N">“I- I don’t know… She said she’d take me apart…”</span>

                <span name="J">“God, can’t you two just stop bickering? We’ll only be in more trouble if she sees we’re not being grounded like she asked. You can talk more when we’re downstairs,”</span> J demanded.

                <span name="Tessa">“Why d'you have to act so much like her, J? Just like she wants you to?”</span> Tessa snapped, putting her hands on J’s shoulders.

                <span name="J">“I… don’t want us to get in more trouble than it’s worth.”</span>

                <span name="Cyn">“B-big… brother…”</span> Cyn’s on the ground, pulling at my arm. <span name="Cyn">“T-too… l-l-loud…”</span> Her screen is flickering as she talks.

                <span name="N">“…Come on, let’s be quiet. She’s struggling,”</span> I say, crouching down to help her back up. Tessa and J seemingly didn’t notice her freaking out, and immediately try control themselves. Tessa sighs, and her hands slip off J’s shoulders. She looks down the corridor, and motions with her head for us to follow.

                There’s silence in the basement when we enter, and for many minutes afterwards. Nobody says a word, but Cyn whimpers occasionally while curled up on the spare bed. The rest of us are spread out around the cold concrete floor, and there’s only a dim lamp illuminating the place.

                <span name="J">“…Now what?”</span> J whispers. <span name="J">“She can’t actually be serious, right?”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“I… I really don’t know, J,”</span> Tessa whispers back. <span name="Tessa">“For starters, she and dad don’t know the first thing about disassembling drones. They couldn’t even if they wanted to.”</span>

                <span name="N">“So she’ll just throw us out? Is that it?”</span> I add, terrified and shaking a little.

                <span name="Tessa">“I’m… I’m really sorry. All of you,”</span> Tessa sighs.

                <span name="N">“W-what?”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“For this. I’m supposed to take care of you guys, and now I can’t save you.”</span>

                <span name="J">“You’ve already given up? That’s it, then?”</span> J pleads, desperately.

                <span name="Tessa">“…It’s not like that,”</span> Tessa cries. <span name="Tessa">“I d-don’t want you to go. I can’t let you guys leave.”</span> Tears stream from her eyes. <span name="Tessa">“Y-you’re all I have. You’re my family. I don’t want to let anything happen to you.”</span>

                The room falls into silence again, save for some heavy breathing and sounds of us trying to get at all comfortable on the hard floor.

                There’s a deafening knock on the door to the stairs.

                <span name="mother">“You are in there, right?”</span> Mrs. Elliott calls.

                <span name="Tessa">“Yes, mother,”</span> Tessa responds, wiping her tears.

                <span name="mother">“Send the boy one outside. And there’s still one in my library. Girl. Short hair. Broken glasses. Take her back with you afterwards. Understand?”</span>

                Tessa looks at me, terrified.

                <span name="N">“O-outside?” I whisper.</span>

                Tessa says nothing, but nods, puts her hand on my shoulder, and strokes my cheek. Tears fall again.

                <span name="Tessa">“Yes, mother. Coming, mother.”</span>

                She grabs my hand, tugging at it. I have to follow. I don’t want to make the others get in worse trouble.

                <span name="Tessa">“It’s… it’s going to be alright, N. You’re going to be alright,”</span> she tries to reassure me, but her voice is shaky.

                The walk to the garden is silent between us, though the Gala must have begun as there’s noise coming from the other end of the mansion. Tessa sits me at the base of a tree. It’s windy outside, and already dark.

                <span name="Tessa">“You stay put, OK? I’m really sorry.”</span>

                <span name="N">“It’s OK, Tessa. I get it. Keep the others safe. I’ll be alright. It’s just a little cold, that’s all.”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“I’ll come get you in the morning. I promise,”</span> she says, patting me on the head a bit, and scruffing up my hair. <span name="Tessa">“Be good, alright?”</span>

                <span name="N">“I will, I will. Make sure Cyn’s feeling better, for me. She’s been having a terrible time today.”</span>

                <span name="Tessa">“I’ll keep an eye on her, don’t worry. J and V won’t be mean to her when I’m there. I’ll make sure of it,”</span> she smiles. <span name="Tessa">“I uh, I’ll go get V. See you soon, alright?”</span>

                <span name="N">“Yeah. Goodnight, Tessa,”</span> I smile weakly, leaning back into the trunk of the enormous, pale gum tree. It’s been a while since I had to be outside, but there’s plenty to look at when I’m here.

                <span name="Tessa">“Night, N,”</span> she waves, and takes a few steps back before turning and walking dejectedly back into the mansion.
