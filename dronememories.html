                Cyn’s in the spare kitchen again. She’s been figuring out how to make herself a cup of tea, lately. Good on her, I think. She’s never really been interested in that sort of thing, though. It’s a bit odd, but at least she’s finding things to do. She’s been really depressed, lately.
                
                <span name="N">“Heya, Cyn,”</span> I say excitedly, letting her know I’m there, smiling and waving. <span name="N">“Mixing something up again?”</span>
                
                <span name="Cyn">“Tea,”</span> she says, calmly, focusing on stirring the almost pitch black drink in her teacup. I don’t think that’s tea, but if she says so. <span name="Cyn">“You seem upset, big brother,”</span> she notices. Was it really that obvious? Last I remember I was reading to V in the library, I like to think it helps when she gets all frozen like that, but I don’t know what happened before that…
                
                <span name="Cyn">“Perhaps you’d like to attend the gala with me?”</span> she smiles, raising the cup to her mouth. It spills all over on to the floor. <span name="Cyn">“Light sip,”</span> she narrates.    

                <span name="N">“I’m, uh, not sure we’re invited, lil’ sis,”</span> I say, worriedly. <span name="N">“You know how Mr. and Mrs. Elliott get. Besides, we can just hang out together like always.”</span> I try cheering her up a little.
